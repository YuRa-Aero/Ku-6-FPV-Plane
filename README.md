Forward swept pusher, basically it's a Dolphin shape with more wing (airfoil) area, less pointy nose and a better performance airfoil (PW51). The fuselage itself is also an airfoil. All angles are at 0Â° / wing (stabs, motor angle, fuselage) so it flies as neutral as possible. It does not exhibit any vicious behaviour, but still I would not recommend this for a beginner because it won't resist abuses as well as a classic EPP foamy. Launches are not difficult in particular, but a pusher will always be trickier to throw than any tractor.

Wing span 84 cm, length : 52 cm
Weight of the naked plane + 2 wing spars : 550gr
Weight of my plane with all FPV gear (FC, ESC, VTX, RX, 2 servos, antennas, HD hybrid camera), no battery : 660gr
AUW including 4S 2200mAh, 230gr battery : 890gr
Recommended motors : 2807 medium kV + 7x5" + or 2307 high kV + 6x5"

##My setup :

- Batttery : Lipo 4S 2200mAh, 230 grams.
- Motor Emax RS2306 Race Spec 2750kV, propeller 6x4.2" Gemfan Flash, top speed 190km/h
- Motor Brotherhobby Avenger 2806.5 1920kV, propeller 7x5.5"HQ prop, slower, still pretty fast
