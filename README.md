 This is fully printable airplane with files prepared for your 3Dprinter. You can Simply download and print
the whole plane or spare parts anytime you need.
Also avalible version with foam-core wing and tail, but 3d printed fuselage and tailbooms. It's much lighter and easy to repair than 3d printed one.

3d structural reinforcement making the model very

It's easy to assembly, you don’t need any extra tools or hardware, just glue printed
parts together and make pushrods for control surfaces. The rest of the assembly is very
easy. Simply add brushless motor, ESC, servos and radio system.

Forward swept pusher, basically it's a Dolphin shape with more wing (airfoil) area, less pointy nose and a better performance airfoil (PW51). The fuselage itself is also an airfoil. All angles are at 0° / wing (stabs, motor angle, fuselage) so it flies as neutral as possible. It does not exhibit any vicious behaviour, but still I would not recommend this for a beginner because it won't resist abuses as well as a classic EPP foamy. Launches are not difficult in particular, but a pusher will always be trickier to throw than any tractor.

Wing span 84 cm, length : 52 cm
Weight of the naked plane + 2 wing spars : 550gr
Weight of my plane with all FPV gear (FC, ESC, VTX, RX, 2 servos, antennas, HD hybrid camera), no battery : 660gr
AUW including 4S 2200mAh, 230gr battery : 890gr
Recommended motors : 2807 medium kV + 7x5" + or 2307 high kV + 6x5"

##My setup :

- Batttery : Lipo 4S 2200mAh, 230 grams.
- Motor Emax RS2306 Race Spec 2750kV, propeller 6x4.2" Gemfan Flash, top speed 190km/h
- Motor Brotherhobby Avenger 2806.5 1920kV, propeller 7x5.5"HQ prop, slower, still pretty fast
