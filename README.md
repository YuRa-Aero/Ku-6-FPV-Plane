 Ku-6 is a backwards swept pusher with big wing area. It can easily take more than 600 gramms of extra weight on flight, so you can install extra systems on it. 
Fuselage has 2 canopies, so it's easier for you to install FC and other electrinics. Aircraft is also compatable for long-range missions, group flights and photo/video shooting

Also avalible version with *foam-core wing and tail*, but 3d printed fuselage and tailbooms. It's much lighter and easy to repair than 3d printed one.

 It's *easy to assembly*, you don’t need any extra tools or hardware, just glue printed
