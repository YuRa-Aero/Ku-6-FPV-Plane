 Ku-6 is a backwards swept pusher with big wing area. It can easily take more than 600 gramms of extra weight on flight, so you can install extra systems on it. 
Fuselage has 2 canopies, so it's easier for you to install FC and other electrinics. Aircraft is also compatable for long-range missions, group flights and photo/video shooting

**DOWNLOAD** : STL files are in "BETA-stl" folder in this repository
 This is *fully printable* airplane with files prepared for your 3Dprinter. You can Simply download and print
the whole plane or spare parts anytime you need.
Also avalible version with *foam-core wing and tail*, but 3d printed fuselage and tailbooms. It's much lighter and easy to repair than 3d printed one.
___
 It's *easy to assembly*, you don’t need any extra tools or hardware, just glue printed
parts together and make pushrods for control surfaces. The rest of the assembly is very
easy. Simply add brushless motor, ESC, servos and radio/FPV system. 

 FPV-canopy + gps/esc mounts are availible

**My setup** :
- ESC: Emax 30A ESC
- Servo:
- -2x SG90S metalgear servo
- -2x 3,7G plastic servo
- Batttery : Lipo 3S 1800mAh, 150 grams.
- Motor Emax ECO II 2207 1700kV, propeller 6x4.2" Gemfan Flash
  
 All angles are at 0° / wing (stabs, motor angle, fuselage) so it flies as neutral as possible.
