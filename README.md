<img src="https://github.com/YuRa-Aero/Ku-6-FPV-Plane/blob/images/main_view.png" align=”right”>

 Ku-6 is a backwards swept pusher with big wing area. It can easily take more than 600 gramms of extra weight on flight, so you can install extra systems on it. 
Fuselage has 2 canopies, so it's easier for you to install FC and other electrinics. Aircraft is also compatable for long-range missions, group flights and photo/video shooting

**DOWNLOAD** : Now I'm testing this plane. The files will be availible soon :)
 This is *fully printable* airplane with files prepared for your 3Dprinter. You can Simply download and print
the whole plane or spare parts anytime you need.
Also avalible version with *foam-core wing and tail*, but 3d printed fuselage and tailbooms. It's much lighter and easy to repair than 3d printed one.

 It's *easy to assembly*, you don’t need any extra tools or hardware, just glue printed
parts together and make pushrods for control surfaces. The rest of the assembly is very
easy. Simply add brushless motor, ESC, servos and radio/FPV system.

My setup :

- Batttery : Lipo 4S 2200mAh, 230 grams.
- Motor Emax RS2306 Race Spec 2750kV, propeller 6x4.2" Gemfan Flash, top speed 190km/h
- Motor Brotherhobby Avenger 2806.5 1920kV, propeller 7x5.5"HQ prop, slower, still pretty fast
Recommended motors : 2807 medium kV + 7x5" + or 2307 high kV + 6x5"
 All angles are at 0° / wing (stabs, motor angle, fuselage) so it flies as neutral as possible. 
3d structural reinforcement making the model very
